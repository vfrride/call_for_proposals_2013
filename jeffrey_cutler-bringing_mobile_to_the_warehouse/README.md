# Bringing Mobile to the Warehouse

This talks outlines the technical, business, and social aspects of bringing an iOS mobile application to the warehouse using jRuby. One of our customers manages import and supply of raw materials to manufacturers throughout the United States and chances are you’ve used their products at least once today. Raw Materials are received from both domestic and foreign sources and the system tracks the full lifecycle of an object from purchase to delivery to the end customer. The ability of the customer to access data throughout the raw material life cycle has allowed them to flourish and increase their sales by an order of magnitude while maintaining the same back end office staff. Recently the customer decided that they needed better access to data about shipments on the warehouse floor and engaged us to write a mobile application to provide increased productivity and better insight into their processes.
