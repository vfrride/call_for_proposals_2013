# Ancient City Ruby 2013 Call for Proposals

So, you are interested in giving a talk at [Anciety City Ruby 2013](http://ancientcityruby.com)?

What better way to submit a talk proposal than via GitHub!

## Here is what to do

1. Fork this repository
2. Copy the sample folder `example/` to `your_name-talk_name`
3. Edit the `README.md` file and type a good description about your talk
   and about yourself
4. Replace the dummy image with a picture of yourself that we
   can use to list you on the speakers page when you are accepted.
5. Create a pull request of your fork. Consider using the title of your
   talk as the pull request subject, as this makes the list of pull requests
   enticing to read.

### Notes

Please submit a separate pull request for each proposal, as we may want to
accept only one of the talks.

You can add any type of assets to support your proposal inside your folder.
When a talk gets accepted we will merge it into master.

Each talk should be 30 minutes in length and will be followed by a 30 minute break.
Proposals will be accepted until December 1st, 2012.
